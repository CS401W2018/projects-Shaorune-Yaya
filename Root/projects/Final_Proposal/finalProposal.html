        <p>Titie: Cat World Guide
            <br>Topic: Introduce different cat personalities and habits around the world, and learn about your cat companions
        </p>
        <li><h3>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h3></li>
        <p>Every cat has its unique personality and habits, some are clingy, some independent, some adventurous, and some lazy at home. I want to design an introduction platform for cats with different personalities, which can help cat owners understand their pets and increase the connection and interaction between humans and cats. This platform will briefly summarize the habits and breeding methods of different breeds of cats, as well as an interactive section for cat owners to share their cats' personalities and interesting stories, creating a community for communicating about cats' daily lives.</p>
