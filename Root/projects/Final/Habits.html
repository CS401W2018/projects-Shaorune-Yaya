                            <h2>Hunting instinct</h2>
                        <p>
                            Cats are naturally excellent hunters, and even in domesticated environments, they exhibit behaviors such as liking to chase and capture objects, such as playing with cat teaser sticks or chasing small toy balls.
                            <br><br>Suggestion: Provide various interactive toys, such as simulated mice and feather cat teasers, to satisfy their hunting desires and avoid them becoming lazy due to boredom.

                            <h2>Grind paws</h2>
                        <p>
                            Grinding paws is a natural instinct of cats, which not only helps them clean their nails, but also marks their territory and releases stress.
                            <br><br> Suggestion: Place cat scratching boards or poles at home to prevent them from rubbing their paws on furniture. Choose the appropriate material and height to make the cat more willing to use it.

                        <p>
                            Cats are very clean animals, and they keep themselves clean by licking their fur and washing their face.
                            <br><br> Suggestion: Regularly grooming cats, especially long haired cats, can reduce hairball problems and enhance interaction between cats and their owners.

                        <p>
                            Cats are nocturnal animals, usually taking naps during the day and being energetic at night.
                            <br><br> Suggestion: Provide toys or interactive time at night to help cats release excess energy. If it disturbs people at night, you can adjust your sleep schedule through regular feeding times.

                        <h3>Create a rich environment:</h3>
                        <p>Provide a space with staggered heights (such as a cat climbing frame), allowing cats to freely jump and observe their surroundings.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ul">
                        <h3>Provide a healthy diet:</h3>
                        <p>A balanced diet and appropriate snack rewards can be provided to increase the enjoyment of eating through food mazes or toys.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="ul">
                        <h3>Respect the independence of cats:</h3>
                        <p>Most cats like to be alone, but they also need their owners' attention and care to find the time and way they enjoy interacting.</p>
