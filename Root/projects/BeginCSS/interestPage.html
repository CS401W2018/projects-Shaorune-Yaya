    <h3>Video games</h3>
        <p>
            As a child, I got my fisrt laptop. During the free time after school, I started to explore the internet and soon found the video games. 
            Back then, the video games I played are mostly flash games on a webpage. Then I started to play single player games like GTASA during junior high age. After that a friend introduced me multiplayer games so I go multiplayers most of time till now. Video games are't something just for fun, its more like my manner to life.

    <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p>
            My first time to swim is when I was in high school, I am not interest in some popular sports like basketball or soccer, so I am looking for a new sport back then, After seeking, I found that swimming is interesting to me, then I learned my self at first and drank a lot of water. Then I figured out my grandmother's friend knows how to swim, so I started to learn from him and loved swimming.
