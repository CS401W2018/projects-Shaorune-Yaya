    <h2>Q&A:</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</li></h3>
        <p>JPEG is suitable for photos that contain rich colors and gradients, such as landscape, portrait photos, etc. It has good image quality and high compression ratio, suitable for scenes that require smaller file sizes.</p>
        <h3><li>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</li></h3>
        <p>The GIF format is suitable for simple graphics or images, such as logos, icons, or images with transparent backgrounds. It supports animation, but the number of colors is limited, so it is not suitable for complex photos.</p>
        <h3><li>What is unique about the PNG format?</li></h3>
        <p>The PNG format supports lossless and transparent backgrounds, making it suitable for high-quality images or images that require transparent backgrounds. It preserves all the details of the image and does not compress or lose information like JPEG.</p>
        <h3><li>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</li></h3>
        <p>I resize my photo by using <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> tags</p>
        <h3><li>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </li></h3>
        <p>Using photo editing software to adjust photo size can directly reduce the file size of images and speed up page loading. If only use CSS to adjust the display size without changing the actual file size of the image, it will affect the webpage's performance.</p>
